#Assignment 2 (practice session)

# Q.1: write a python program to input student name and marks of 3 subjects. Print name & percentage in output

# name = input("Enter your name: ")
# maths= input("Enter your marks in maths: ")
# hindi= input("Enter your marks in hindi: ")
# english= input("Enter your marks in english: ")
# totalpercentage=((int(maths) + int(hindi) + int(english))/300)*100
# #calculating percentage
# print(f"Wow your name is {name}. This is a beautiful name.")
# print(f"So, the total percentage is {int(totalpercentage)} % is your percentage. Well done! ")

# # Optimized solution
# print("Percentage calculator")
# name = input("Enter your beautiful name: ")
# maths= int(input("Enter your maths marks: "))
# hindi= int(input("Enter your hindi marks: "))
# english= int(input("Enter your english marks: "))
# #calculating percentage
# percentage= (((maths + hindi + english)/ 300)*100)
# print(f"The result of {name} is {percentage}% has shown that she is a bright student.")

# Q.2. Write a python program that collects multiple types of data (e.g., name, age, height, and student status) from user input
# and stores them in a dictionary, and then prints out the collected data.

# print("Creating a dictionary")
# name = dict(input("Enter your beautiful name: "))
# age = dict(input("Enter your age: "))
# height = dict(input("Enter your height: "))
# status = dict(input("Enter your Student status: "))

# dictionary= dict(name: , age:, height: , status:)
